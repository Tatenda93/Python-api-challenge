# Python-api-challenge

This script script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
In this  script , we used scatter plots and linear regression  to visualize the realtionship between the following ,using data from Geoapify API and the geoViews:

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

This script also uses maps to display a point for every city included in our data frame. 

This script also uses use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates and is viusualized on a map
